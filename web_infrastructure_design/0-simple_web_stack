A server is a computer or software that provides functionality or services to other devices or programs, in this case, hosting the website.
The domain name is used to provide a readable, easy-to-remember address for the website, rather than relying on IP addresses.
The DNS www record is an A record that specifies the IP address associated with the "www" subdomain of foobar.com.
The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests, serves static files, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
The application server hosts the application code and handles the logic and processing of user requests, generating dynamic content if necessary.
The database (MySQL) stores and retrieves data required by the application, such as user information, publications or other relevant data.
The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP protocol, sending the requested web pages or the corresponding responses.
As for the problems of this infrastructure:

Single point of failure (SPOF): the entire infrastructure depends on a single server. If it fails, the website becomes inaccessible.
Downtime during maintenance: When performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code, the web server may need to be restarted, resulting in temporary downtime.
Limited scalability: With a single server, it can be difficult to handle high incoming traffic effectively. Scaling becomes a challenge without additional servers or load balancing mechanisms.
